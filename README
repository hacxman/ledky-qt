Basebar
#######

To test, try this:

./basebar & sleep 1; python send.py EAN-13:5901234123457

It will automatically create new database if one is missing, prefilled with some test data.
send.py will send "recognized" EAN code to basebar.

To try "normal" run, start it as

./basebar

and, then run barcode scanner such as:

zbarcam | python send.py -

Deploy
######

It is intended that it would run fullscreen, under some very minimal window manager such as xmonad.
Basebar is a DBus service too, where it listens for incoming barcodes. For convenient hand over of these
barcodes, there is a send.py utility - it accepts codes from arguments and stdin. So it is not
restricted to one barcode scanner.

Some example could be:

echo "xmonad" >> ~/.xinitrc
echo "basebar" >> ~/.xinitrc
echo "zbarcam | python /BASEBARPATH/send.py -" >> ~/.xinitrc
